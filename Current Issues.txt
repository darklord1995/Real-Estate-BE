To do : 
1) Think of parameters that can be scraped specific to general locations 
2) Scrape at least 1 more parameter 
3) Format the data and fit it in a csv file
	- need to think of a way for efficiently representing quarters along a dimension. Example : The 0 should possibly be 2000Q1 ?
PS : We can create a text file and then use a text to csv converter like app
4) Build a multivariate model




Details : 

Current Parameters : 
1) Time
2) Distance to Most exp place
3) Distance to Airport
4) _______________

Input : 
Vasai 	- x no of inputs and x ops
NSP		= y no of inputs and y ops 
.
.

PS : ~85% % of the data should be used for training. For now, we can set the last 5 quarters for testing. Remaining should be used for training.
~ Also note that the only factor changing in the x inputs for one place is possibly going to be time! All the other factors remain constant unless we look at developments that were made in the training period.
